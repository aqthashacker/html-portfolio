<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2><hr >
<h3>The Dark Knight Returns</h3>
<p>The Dark Knight Rises" is my favorite Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, providing a thrilling and epic finale. Christian Bale 
    delivers a compelling performance as Bruce Wayne(Batman), showcasing the character's vulnerability 
    and strength. The performance of Bane by Tom Hardy is intimidating and memorable, while the performance of Catwoman by Anne 
    Hathaway
     adds charm and complexity. The plot is subtle and interesting, exploring themes of redemption, sacrifice, and resilience. It 
     effectively builds tension, offering a gripping and emotionally intense experience for both characters and viewers alike.It 
     captivates audiences with its stunning visuals and deep themes, immersing them in a world of grandeur and ambition. 
     With a talented cast led by Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman, the 
     movie delves into the inner struggles of its characters, adding layers of depth to the narrative.As the final installment of 
     Nolan's Batman series, "The Dark Knight Rises" creates the Dark Knight's enduring legacy in cinema, leaving a lasting impression 
     on audiences.</p>
<p> As the plot unfolds, Bruce Wayne 
     comes out of retirement to protect Gotham from the menacing Bane, who aims to destroy the city after confronting the Joker. Batman 
     faces physical and 
     emotional challenges, assisted like Catwoman and Commissioner Gordon, as he strives to save Gotham and its people. There are
     memorable quotes from the movie, such as Selina Kyle's warning about an impending storm, "There's a storm coming, Mr. 
     Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, 'cause when it hits, you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought
      you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us," Bane's chilling declaration of punishment, "You don't fear 
      death. You welcome it. Your punishment must be more severe," Batman's reflection on heroism, "A hero can be anyone. Even a man 
      doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy's shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended," 
      Bane's rhetoric of upheaval, "The powerful will be ripped from their decadent nests and cast out into the cold world that we know 
      and endure," and John Blake's realization of the limitations of authority in the face of chaos, "There's a point, far out there 
      when the structures fail you, and the rules aren't weapons anymore, they're shackles, letting the bad guy get ahead." These quotes 
      not only contribute to the depth of the narrative but also underscore the film's enduring impact on audiences.
